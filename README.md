"MRQAP_Polarization_asnipe_server_12.R" is the R script for data preparation of the MRQAP-DSP models. Individual data is transformed into matrices of "sameness" and "absolute differences", the the models are estimated.

"moral_org_polarization_MRQAP_2025_01_31_R_S_3rdsubmission.do" is the Stata do-file used to prepare the original data from the more in common organization. This is executed 1st, the R script afterwards. It is important to note that the complete "fault lines" data set is available via a data request form from the organization "more in common".

"0_RS2025_more_in_common_similarity_network_TRUNC100.zip" is the network, that is, the similarity matrix, where similarity scores > 100 have been truncated to 100.

"0_RS2025_more_in_common_similarity_network1.zip" is the network, that is, the similarity matrix, without such a truncation.
